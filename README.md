overview of the proect project:SOCIAL MEDIA SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

Objectives

Understand Public Sentiment:
Analyze social media data to gauge general sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) on specific topics, products, or events.

Track Sentiment Trends Over Time:
Monitor how sentiment changes in response to events or marketing campaigns to identify spikes in sentiment and public opinion shifts.

Identify Influential Factors:
Uncover keywords, hashtags, and phrases that drive sentiment, helping to pinpoint key topics of interest, complaints, or praise.

Support Decision-Making:
Provide insights to guide marketing, customer service, and product development based on sentiment patterns and emerging trends.

Benchmark Competitively:
Compare sentiment on specific topics against competitors to assess relative public perception and market positioning.

Key Activities

Data Collection:
Use APIs to gather relevant social media data (e.g., tweets about a product, topic, or event) based on keywords, hashtags, or other filters.

Data Preprocessing:
Clean the data by removing noise like stopwords, URLs, and special characters, and tokenize the text to make it suitable for analysis.

Sentiment Analysis:
Apply sentiment analysis techniques to assign sentiment scores to each post or text, categorizing them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Visualization:
Create charts and graphs to visualize sentiment trends over time, sentiment distribution, and any correlations between sentiment and events.

Reporting and Insights:
Summarize findings, identifying key sentiment drivers and patterns, and present actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

Technologies Used

Data Collection:
Tweepy (for accessing Twitter API): To collect live tweets based on specified keywords or hashtags.

Data Preprocessing and NLP:
